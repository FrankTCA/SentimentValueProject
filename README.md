# Sentiment Value Project

This is the project I created for AP CSA on Sentiment Value.

I will add jar files for each of the versions of the project in Releases.

The open-ended part of the project is available here: https://github.com/FrankTCA/SentimentValueOpenEnded

This program is designed to run on macOS Big Sur. Running it on other Operating Systems like Windows may cause issues.

Put the ProgramData folder inside of your documents folder. This folder is needed as it has the reviews inside of it.

You will have to put astericks in SimpleReview.txt to get the randomizer to work properly.

Thanks.
