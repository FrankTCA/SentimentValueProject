Brought here by my brother and his wife for a weeknight dinner. Wow, I thought a good Italian restaurant in Baton Rouge. First thing I noticed was there was no pizza on the menu. I have been to a lot of Italian restaurants and this was a first. I ordered the veal Parmesan and my brother and his wife split a pasta a meat balls dish. First thing I noticed was the "garlic bread" was swimming in butter. The veal was overcooked and chewy, the pasta overcook and mushy and the tomato sauce too sweet for this dish. I have lived for three years in Naples, Italy and over 15 in Europe and this place does not come close to any Italian I have had. As a chef, I can find better in Baton Rouge or make it myself.
