This is only my 2nd time eating at this restaurant...haven’t been disappointed yet. When you get seated they bring you bread and a homemade sweet red sauce! It’s absolutely delicious! I ordered the eggplant sticks as a meal! Someone ordered the lasagna and said it would’ve been better with the sweet sauce rather than the sauce it came with.

They also ordered the fried ravioli, but said multiple times that it was spicy.
